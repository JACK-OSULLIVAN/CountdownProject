# CountdownProject
  The aim of this project is to play countdown so I can appear like I know words and math.
  
# Word Section
  For the words section I want to proivde the user a choice between 
  consonant or vowel and generate a list of 9 letters from their choices.
    
The project will then take the possible permutations and cross-reference the outcomes with the ENABLE dictionary 
where it will then determine the highest scoring word possible
    
Additional features I plan to implement:
  - Twillo API to send the answer to my phone
  - Determine the optimal combination of letters to vowels to achieve highest average score (make distribution plots to visualise).
  - Final addition will be weighting the choice between consonant or vowel depending on previous letters recieved to optimize high score.

# Numbers Section 
  I will be following the game rules to determine if the final number is possible to calculate.
  
  If multiple options are possible I then want it to determine the shortest possible solution (least amount of numbers used)
